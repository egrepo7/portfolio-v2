# portfolio-v2

This is the second version of my portfolio I have created. Compared to my first portfolio, my goal was to try not to be as dependant on the bootstrap framework. Majority of styling using CSS from scratch. I also used jquery to create a fading navbar. This is a Single page portfolio using modals to for the portfolio work section.
