# portfolio-v2

<p>This is the second version of my portfolio I have created.</p>

<p>Compared to my first portfolio, my goal was to try not to be as dependant on the bootstrap framework.</p>

<ul> 
  <li>Majority of styling using CSS from scratch.</li> 
  <li>I also used jquery to create a fading navbar.</li>
  <li>This is a Single page portfolio using modals to for the portfolio work section.</li>
</ul>
