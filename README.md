# portfolio-v2

This is the second version of my portfolio I have created. 
Compared to my first portfolio, my goal was to try not to be as dependant on the bootstrap framework.

• Majority of styling using CSS from scratch.
• Used jquery to create a fading navbar
• Single page portfolio using modals
